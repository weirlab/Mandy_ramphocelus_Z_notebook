#when running another program that requires openmpi, you might have to fist indicate the location of the program. We often do this as follows before running the program:

export PATH=/home/0_PROGRAMS/openmpi-4.0.5/bin:$PATH

#That line tells the computer to search in that path for programs it is looking to run.

#You can verify it is working by running:

export PATH=/home/0_PROGRAMS/openmpi-4.0.5/bin:$PATH
mpiexec --version
